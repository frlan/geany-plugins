# UpdateChecker

## About


UpdateChecker is a plugin for Geany, which is able to check whether
there is a more recent version of Geany available.

## Features

* Checks whether there is a more recent Geany-version available

## Requirements

* libsoup-2.4 >= 2.42

## Installation

This version of the plugin is installed with the combined
geany-plugins release. Please check README of this package
and/or https://plugins.geany.org/install.html.

If you want to explicit install the plugin you have to run configure with the `--enable-plugin`-flag:

    ./configure --enable-plugin=updatechecker

## Usage

After installed successfully, load the plugin in Geany's plugin manager
and a new menu item in the Tools menu will appear.

When pushing the entry inside the menu bar, the plugin will try to get
in contact with the Geany-servers and figure out, whether there has
been a new version released. The result will be printed within an info
popup.

In default configuration the plugin will not check automatically for new
versions. But you can change this by activating this in the
configuration dialog. Once a new version of Geany is released, this
feature will create a popup until you have updated Geany and its
plugins. This has potential to plague you with Geany's new version.

## Configuration

### Automatic check at startup of Geany

If you want to enable autoamtic checking, you have to check "Run
updatecheck on startup" at plugin's configuration dialog.
